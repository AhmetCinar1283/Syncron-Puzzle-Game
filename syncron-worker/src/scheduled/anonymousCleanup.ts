/**
 * Anonymous User Cleanup — Scheduled Cron Trigger
 *
 * Runs daily at 04:00 UTC via Cloudflare Cron Triggers.
 * Deletes D1 records for stale anonymous users — those whose `user_profiles`
 * entry has `tag IS NULL` (real users always get a tag from Cloud Functions)
 * AND whose `updated_at` is older than ANONYMOUS_RETENTION_DAYS.
 *
 * Why `tag IS NULL` as the anonymous proxy?
 *   All real (non-anonymous) users get a unique tag auto-assigned by the
 *   `onUserCreated` / `onUserUpgraded` Firebase Cloud Function within seconds
 *   of registration. Anonymous users skip that trigger, so their D1 profile
 *   (if any — created lazily on first level completion) always has tag = NULL.
 *
 * Coordination with Firebase Functions:
 *   Firebase Functions runs its own cleanup at 04:05 UTC (5 min later), which
 *   deletes the corresponding Firebase Auth accounts and Firestore documents.
 *   The two jobs are fully independent — no HTTP calls between them.
 *
 * Safety:
 *   - Uses batched DELETE to avoid D1 statement size limits.
 *   - Each table is deleted separately (D1 batch API does not cascade).
 *   - Errors per UID are caught individually to avoid aborting the whole run.
